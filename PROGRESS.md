## Architecture Status

âœ… **Foundation Enhanced**:
- Clean Architecture (Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Api)
- CQRS with MediatR + Base Handler Classes
- FastEndpoints for API
- Comprehensive test framework with shared utilities
- TDD workflow scripts
- GitHub board integration scripts
- Full architecture documentation in `/docs`

**Current Focus**: Ready to build Local API Server for workflow enforcement.
