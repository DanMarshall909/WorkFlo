# Create standardized commit message
COMMIT_MSG="feat: $DESCRIPTION

- Implement $HOOK_NAME hook with comprehensive TDD approach
- Create extensive test suite with $TEST_COUNT test cases
- Achieve ${STMT_COV}% statement coverage
- Achieve ${BRANCH_COV}% branch coverage  
- Achieve ${FUNC_COV}% function coverage
- Achieve ${LINE_COV}% line coverage
- Follow advanced React patterns (useReducer, useCallback, TypeScript)
- Use business-focused test naming conventions

Advanced patterns demonstrated:
- State machine architecture with useReducer
- Performance optimization with useCallback
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- TDD with comprehensive edge case coverage
